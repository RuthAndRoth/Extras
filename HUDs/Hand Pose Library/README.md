Here's a summary of what's in this directory (Hand Pose Library and HUD) from Chimera Firecaster . . .

I’ve finished creating a series of Bento hand poses. There are 14 different poses, but the number of animation files resulting from the poses actually totals 42. The higher number is the result of creating 3 animation files for each pose: right, left and dual-hand versions. They have all been built from scratch, especially for Ruth in Blender.

The poses have been placed in two different sub-folders in GitHub. One folder contains all 42 of the animation files. The other folder is named “Script Ready Hand Pose Package” and it includes 24 animations (one right and one left) that are ready to be dropped in the Hand Pose HUD.

Among the files in GitHub, you will find a Blender file which contains the Ruth hand pose library. You can import the library to a Blender file and add your own animations or tweak the existing ones. They also provide a starting point for creating moving animations.

I did all of the animation and texture work, but I enlisted the help of Sundance to do most of the coding for the HUD which animates the hands in-world. (Why should I have all fun? Big grin.) Sundance was also kind enough to prepare two instructional PDF documents. (I owe him big time. Even bigger grin!) One document explains how to assemble the HUD and the other explains how to use the hand pose library and create your own poses.

To keep everything together, Sundance has uploaded everything in GetHub into one folder: Mesh / Sundance / Hand Pose Library & HUD

We’d appreciate it if you would test the HUD. We have the Hand Pose HUD set-up and ready to go at Ruth’s Second Life sandbox (http://maps.secondlife.com/secondlife/Gamma/21/76/1401). But we also need to have it tested in OpenSim as well. OpenSim testers will need to assemble it first, but with the instructions, it’s pretty easy to put together.

I expect in the future, for the sake of efficiency, the functions of the hand pose HUD will be combined with other Ruth functions, i.e. fingernails, etc. The design and layout of the HUD can be changed as needed, but this provides a solid starting point.

I would like to improve the clarity of the individual hand pose illustrations. (The current ones are screen saves from within Blender.) If any of you with an artistic bent have an alternative way of presenting them, I’d love to see your ideas.

One last thing. All of our testing in SL is showing that the Bento poses work fine. The Bento animation files are dual purpose and also include hand morphs for system hands. The morphs, however, are not working. I’m not sure if it’s a procedural problem on my part, or if it’s some sort of bug in Avastar. The procedure that I followed is included in the documentation (there’s even a picture!). If you have a chance, I’d appreciate if you would take a look and see if you might have a solution. Altho
ugh the HUD is primarily for Bento hands, but I’d like to include the system hand morphs if possible.

Okay testers, have at it!
