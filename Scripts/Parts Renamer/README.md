Thanks to the Fejui Love's awesome visualization of the part name on the Ruth 2.0 body, I have not only been able to create a table with the part list, original part names, and required descriptions. I took it one step further and created a script which automagically renames the entire body to the proper part names, and fills the description fields with the proper descriptions.

I hope this will be useful to some people.
