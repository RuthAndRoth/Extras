Thanks to Fejui Love's awesome visualization of the parts names on the Ruth 2.0 body, I have not only been able to create a table with the parts list, original parts names, and required descriptions.
I took it one step further and created a script which automagically renames the parts of the entire body to their proper part names, and fills the description fields with the proper descriptions.

I hope this will be useful to some people.

See the file Procedure.txt for instructions of how to use this script.
